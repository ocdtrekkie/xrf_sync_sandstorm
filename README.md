# XRF Sync for Sandstorm

XRF Sync is a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, with the ability to permit messages between different endpoints in specific scenarios. It was originally built to support the [HAController](https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/HAController) home automation software, however, today the preferred client is [XRFAgent](https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/XRFAgent) which can, in turn, pass commands through to HAC via LocalQueue mode.
